So, while you are lossing the weight and muscles are reappearing, this program will also help tone those muscles into a nice healthy looking shape. Perform as many reps as possible within the time given for the workout on each day. Also, while going through the program, keep in mind that on your days that Skimble will not be at your side you should keep moving. Try not to have a single day where you've sat for more than 75% of the day. Remember, being is a lifestyle not an end point, so incorporating activity into your daily routine will help keep creeping pounds at bay. Complete the full program in Workout Trainer after doing thr first two workouts in Samsung Health" ,
